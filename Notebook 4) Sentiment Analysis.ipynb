It also means that the alignment would have to cross an incredible amount of small land holdings and probably quite close to a lot of settlements without being able to justifiably serve them. This only adds cost, complexity and hurts public support. Luckily changing this settlement pattern would also bring a load of [other benefits](https://irishplanningblog.wordpress.com/ruralhousing/) when it comes to public service provision (roads, healthcare, electricity, etc.) so on the scale of the next 50 years it kinda has to be done anyway.\n",

The Limerick-Dublin train doesn't stop at the junction and while the first shuttle is returning back to Limerick on the single track, they're not able to send a later train that can make it on time for the Dublin-Cork train. In most other circumstances you only have to wait maybe 5 or 10 minutes...without delaye\n",
