"The entire rail review process needs to think bigger. The idea seems to be to reduce travel times between Dublin and everywhere else on the Island, while integrating with the DART+ expanded light rail system in Dublin. This means Dublin will continue to be the bottleneck. 

A better option would be to introduce a true HSR system from Belfast to Cork, with stops at Newry, Dundalk, Navan, Wexford, Waterford, etc., and a line extension from Cork to Galway, with a junction at Limerick, where a Limerick-Dublin line meets up with it. 

This should be a proper HSR, 300kmph, so that we add about 20 new commuter towns, enabling people to build property in any of those towns at lower cost than in Dublin, and making it possible for foreign companies to set up shop in Cork, Limerick, Wexford, Waterford, Athlone, Navan, etc. instead of just blindly picking Dublin. 

Imagine working for Google in Dublin, but being able to take the train to Waterford and be home in an hour. Why buy a 400k house in Dublin when you could buy the same house for 200k in Waterford? 

We need big thinking, not incrementalism. Our policy should be to become green, energy independent, lower electricity costs, lower housing costs, all with a single sweeping policy.

"Letterkenny will get its first connection to the mainline rail network ever which I forgot to add to the map.

What this map doesn't include at all is the large upgrades to the rail network around Cork including speed upgrades, capacity upgrade, resignalling and the cork area commuter rail program.

There is also an inclusion of  a direct curve between the Limerick-Waterford line and the Cork-Dublin line.

"The 1-hour journey makes Belfast a commuter suburb of Dublin. The regeneration effects there would be absolutely immense.

84 minutes is different. Now we're talking about a 2 hour plus journey, door to door. No longer a commuter trip.

You're right that it's sane to weave in express trains with stopping trains in between.

Then the question comes about whether those share the same alignment or not. If we're building a 300km/h Cork-Dublin-Belfast line, it's a new alignment, will have its own dedicated trains, and may as well be standard gauge, so that it's cheaper and faster to get rolling stock from the international market.

If we want stopping trains on it too, then a lot of it has to be 4 track.
